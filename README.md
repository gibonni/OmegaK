This is implementation of omega k algorithm for reconstructing pictures from synthetic aperture radar. 
Original test picture has 3 objects scanned on table with different EM properties. 
Second picture has one object (aluminum can) placed on table. On that picture you can see repeating pattern, like some sort of reflections of the original object.
That is a sinc pattern as it can be shown mathematicaly by modeling signal sent and received by SAR.
